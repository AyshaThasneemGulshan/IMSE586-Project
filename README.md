# Big Data Analytics – Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Analysis

## Project Overview
Obesity is a major public health concern in the United States, linked to serious conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.  
This project analyzes **nutrition, physical activity, and obesity** patterns using the BRFSS dataset collected by the CDC.  
The goal is to understand how lifestyle behaviors, diet, and physical activity impact obesity rates across U.S. adults and states.

## Research Questions
1. How does **fruit and vegetable consumption per day** relate to **BMI** among U.S. adults?
2. Identify **clusters of U.S. states** based on lifestyle behaviors.
3. Does **income level** affect obesity rates among adults? 
4. Do **states with higher physical activity** participation have lower obesity rates?

## Key Insights (From RQs 1 & 4)
- Higher fruit and vegetable intake is associated with lower BMI across most adult age groups.
- States with higher physical activity participation tend to have lower obesity rates, highlighting the impact of active lifestyles on public health.
