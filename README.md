# Big Data Analytics – Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Analysis

## Project Overview
Obesity is a major public health concern in the United States, linked to serious conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.  
This project analyzes **nutrition, physical activity, and obesity** patterns using the BRFSS dataset collected by the CDC.  
The goal is to understand how lifestyle behaviors, diet, and physical activity impact obesity rates across U.S. adults and states.

## Research Questions
1. How does **fruit and vegetable consumption per day** relate to **BMI** among U.S. adults?
2. Identify **clusters of U.S. states** based on lifestyle behaviors.
3. Does **income level** affect obesity rates among adults?
4. Do **states with higher physical activity** participation have lower obesity rates?

## My Contribution
I specifically worked on **Research Questions 1 and 4**:
- **RQ1:** Performed data cleaning, transformation, and multiple linear regression analysis to quantify the relationship between fruit/vegetable intake and BMI while controlling for demographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education, physical activity).
- **RQ4:** Used Decision Tree Classifier and comparative analysis to investigate whether states with higher physical activity levels have lower obesity rates. Merged location and year data and analyzed relevant features.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier)

---

## Key Insights
- Higher fruit and vegetable intake is associated with lower BMI across most adult age groups.
- States with higher physical activity participation tend to have lower obesity rates, highlighting the impact of active lifestyles on public health.

## Dataset
**Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - BRFSS dataset**  
Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system
Contains state-level statistics on nutrition, physical activity, and obesity.

## Future Work
- Complete remaining research questions (RQ2 & RQ3)
- Explore clustering of states based on lifestyle behaviors
- Examine the effect of income on obesity rates
